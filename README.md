# Greetings!

Some people say that I am a big nerd. I agree with them.  
I really like to play with computers and the stuff around them.

I am passionate at learning things about IT: Programming, GNU/Linux, Cryptography, Videogames, and a bit of Math.

If you want to learn more about me and check my project board/portfolio/blog, you can [visit my GitHub pages website](https://khyrthy.github.io)
